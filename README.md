# 6-persons-at-a-party-problem

Statement :
Suppose there are six people at a party. Prove that it is always possible to find either three people who all know each other, or three people none of whom knows either of the other two.

The wording seems ludicrous! What if one person knows all five of the others, but none of the others knows anyone but that one person who knows all the five? Or any other combination? All six know each other. All six came to a party, none knowing anyone else.
